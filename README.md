## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI | Formula | Purpose |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Revenue Lift (%)** | ((Dynamic - Static) / Static) × 100 | Measures gain achieved using AI-based pricing. |
| **Profit Margin (%)** | ((Revenue - Cost) / Revenue) × 100 | Evaluates efficiency in cost-to-revenue ratio. |
| **Conversion Rate (%)** | (Completed Rides / Total Rides) × 100 | Indicates how many ride requests were successfully completed. |

## 🧩 Milestones Overview

### 🧹 Milestone 1 — Data Preparation & Cleaning
- Processed and explored the ride dataset for missing and inconsistent values.  
- Handled outliers and standardized numerical and categorical variables.  
- Created visualizations like bar charts, scatter plots, and boxplots for trend insights.  
📁 **Notebook:** `Requirements_and_Data_Preparation.ipynb`

---

### ⚙️ Milestone 2 — Data Ingestion & KPI Computation
- Designed a **data ingestion workflow** using Pandas for smoother preprocessing.  
- Introduced automation to handle data updates and consistency checks.  
- Computed critical KPIs: **Revenue Lift**, **Profit Margin**, and **Conversion Rate**.  
📁 **Notebook:** `Data_Ingestion_Pipeline.ipynb`

---

### 🔍 Milestone 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering
- Conducted advanced EDA to identify key relationships among variables.  
- Encoded categorical features and derived new insights.  
- Applied segmentation combining **Loyalty Status** and **Seasonality** to understand price variation.  
📁 **Notebook:** `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`

---

### 💰 Milestone 4 — Static Baseline Pricing Engine
- Created a **rule-based pricing system** as a static baseline model.  
- Integrated **time-based** and **inventory-based** pricing logic.  
- Compared dynamic pricing outcomes to baseline values using KPIs to analyze uplift.  
📁 **Notebook:** `Baseline_Pricing_Engine.ipynb`

---

### 🤖 Milestone 5 — Machine Learning Model for Dynamic Pricing
- Developed predictive models using **Linear Regression**, **XGBoost**, and **LightGBM**.  
- Trained and tested models to estimate optimized ride prices.  
- Assessed performance improvement using KPI metrics to validate pricing accuracy.  
📁 **Notebook:** `Advanced_ML_Model_Development.ipynb`

**Outcome:**  
The machine learning approach showed measurable improvement in pricing precision and better overall KPI performance compared to the static rule-based model.
